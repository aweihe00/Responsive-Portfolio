                    <h2>Welcome to my Page</h2>
                    <p>I currently work at a winery and vineyard called Arrington Vineyards as apart of the outside crew. I have been working there for over two years. I have worked many different in and out jobs. I also got to work and travel in Belize three summers ago for a property managemement company working on resorts and even private islands</p>
                    <p>I've always had a big imagination and a love for creation. I think my favorite part is getting to see the finished product at the end. It is such a satisfying feeling knowing all the hard work that was put into the final result.</p>
                    <p>It's time to improve my computer knowledge and to adapt to a rapidly changing web development community by adding all the necessary skills to my tool belt. Therefore, this is why I came to the decision to join Vanderbilt University's Coding Bootcamp.</p>
                    <p>I'm a handy man around the house, I have a lovely girlfriend and three great puppers. I love problem solving, so all four of those give me ample opportunites to put my skills to the test.</p>
                    <p>Check out my <a href="portfolio.html">projects</a> or <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a> with me.</p>
