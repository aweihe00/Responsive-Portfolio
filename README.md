Directions
First, you will use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to recreate your portfolio. How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

Create the following pages: index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.

Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

A navbar

A responsive layout

Responsive images

The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

Hints

Use Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).

On an xs screen, content should take up the entire screen. On sm and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.
